"""
Write a function that takes in an n x m 2-D array and returns a 1-D array of all the array's elements in spiral order.

Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes to the right, and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited.
"""

"""
Hint 1: You can think of the spiral that you have to traverse as a set of rectangle perimeters that progressively get smaller.

Hint 2:
> Declare 4 variables: a starting row, a starting column, an ending row, and an ending column. These 4 variables represent the bounds of the first rectangle perimeter in the spiral that you have to traverse.
> Traverse that perimeter using those bounds, and then move the bounds inwards.
> End your algorithm once the starting row passes the ending row or the starting column passes the ending column.

Hint 3: This can be solved iteratively or recursively.

Optimal time and space complexity: O(n) - n is the number of elements in the 2-D array.
